title: Practical Exercises
---

Let's get hands-on with data science! These exercises will give you practical experience with core data science tasks. 

The practical is divided into 4 sections, each building on the previous one. You can work through them at your own pace.

## 📚 Practical Sections

### [1. Basics](practical-basics.qmd)

Start here! Learn how to load and explore data. This section covers:
- Loading datasets in R and Python
- Exploring data structure and content
- Calculating basic statistics
- Understanding your data before analysis

### [2. Data Manipulation](practical-data-manipulation.qmd)

Learn how to filter, transform, and summarize your data effectively:
- Filter data based on conditions
- Group data and calculate summaries
- Transform variables
- Work with multiple conditions

## 💡 Tips for Success

- **Work through in order**: Each section builds on previous knowledge
- **Download the code**: Each section has downloadable R and Python scripts
- **Practice actively**: Don't just read—run the code and modify it!
- **Ask questions**: If you get stuck, ask your neighbor or the instructor
