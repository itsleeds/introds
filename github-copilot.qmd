title: GitHub Copilot & AI Tools
---

AI-powered coding assistants can significantly accelerate your data science learning journey. Let's explore how to use them effectively!

## GitHub Copilot

**GitHub Copilot** is an AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster and with fewer errors.

### What is GitHub Copilot?

- AI-powered code completion tool
- Suggests whole lines or blocks of code as you type
- Understands context from your code and comments
- Trained on billions of lines of public code

### For Students

Good news! Students get **free access** to GitHub Copilot:

1. Visit [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/)
2. Apply for the Student Developer Pack
3. Verify your student status (usually with university email)
4. Access Copilot for free while you're a student

### Installing GitHub Copilot

**For RStudio:**

- Currently, Copilot is not natively integrated in RStudio
- However, you can use VS Code with R extension as an alternative

**For VS Code:**

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the GitHub Copilot extension from the marketplace
3. Sign in with your GitHub account

**For Python/Jupyter:**

- Works seamlessly in VS Code with Python extension
- Also available in JupyterLab with Copilot extension

## Using AI Tools Effectively

### Best Practices

::: {.callout-tip}
## Writing Good Prompts
- Write clear comments describing what you want to do
- Use descriptive variable names
- Break complex tasks into smaller steps
:::

### Example in R

```{r}
#| eval: false

# Load a CSV file of transport data and calculate average trip distance
# Copilot might suggest:
library(tidyverse)
data <- read_csv("transport_data.csv")
avg_distance <- data %>% 
  summarise(mean_distance = mean(trip_distance, na.rm = TRUE))
```

### Example in Python

```{python}
#| eval: false

# Load transport data and visualize trip distribution
# Copilot might suggest:
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = pd.read_csv("transport_data.csv")
data['trip_distance'].hist(bins=30)
plt.xlabel('Trip Distance')
plt.show()
```

## Other AI Tools for Data Science

### ChatGPT / Claude

- Great for explaining concepts
- Helps debug error messages
- Suggests approaches to data problems
- **Tip**: Copy error messages and ask for explanations

### Stack Overflow & Forums

While not AI per se, these communities are invaluable:

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Programming Q&A
- [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/) - R-specific help
- [r/datascience](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/) - Data science discussions

## Learning with AI

### Dos ✅

- Use AI to understand error messages
- Ask AI to explain unfamiliar code
- Use suggestions to learn new approaches
- Verify AI-generated code before using it

### Don'ts ❌

- Don't blindly copy-paste without understanding
- Don't use AI to do all your work (you won't learn!)
- Don't share sensitive data with AI tools
- Don't assume AI code is always correct

::: {.callout-warning}
## Critical Thinking Required
AI tools are powerful assistants, but they can make mistakes. Always review and test the code they generate!
:::

## Practical Exercise

Try this during the session:

1. Install Copilot (if you haven't already)
2. Write a comment describing a simple data task
3. See what Copilot suggests
4. Compare with how you would solve it
5. Learn from the differences!
