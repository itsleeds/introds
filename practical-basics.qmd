title: "Practical: Basics"
---

Let's get started with the fundamentals of data science! This section covers loading and exploring data.

## Exercise 1: Loading and Exploring Data

### In R

Let's work with a built-in dataset about cars:

```{r}
#| eval: false

# Load tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

# Look at the mtcars dataset
head(mtcars)

# Get basic statistics
summary(mtcars)

# Check the structure
str(mtcars)
```

**Your Task**: Explore the dataset and answer:
- How many cars are in the dataset?
- What variables are included?
- What is the average miles per gallon (mpg)?

### In Python

```{python}
#| eval: false

import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns

# Load a sample dataset
df = sns.load_dataset('mpg')

# Explore the data
print(df.head())
print(df.describe())
print(df.info())
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

::: {.callout-note}
## Error: Package not found
Make sure you've installed the package first:
```r
install.packages("package_name")
```

::: {.callout-note}
## Error: Object not found
Check that you've run all previous code chunks in order. Variables from earlier chunks need to be created first!

## Key Takeaways

After completing this exercise, you should be able to:

✅ Load datasets in R and Python  
✅ Explore data structure and content  
✅ Calculate basic statistics  
✅ Understand your data before analysis
