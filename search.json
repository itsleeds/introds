    "text": "Introduction to Version control\n\nGit\nWorking with code/scripts/notebooks usually involves preparing them, revising and editing their content, and sharing with others. After completing at least one round of this process you can end up with several different versions of the same file. Are you familiar with Figure 1?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Version control. From: programmerhumor.io\n\n\n\nGit is a great tool that tracks changes to files over time, especially in text-based files such as scripts, allowing multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each other’s work. When Git is used as a version control system, a full copy of the entire project history is stored, making it easy to keep track of any changes, and even revert any changes. By using Git, it is possible to have different alternative versions of the same project, i.e. repository, without the need for independent files or folders for each version.\n\n\n\nGit Workflow. From: Git for Data Science by Juha Kiili\n\n\n\n\nGitHub\nGitHub is a platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. As a cloud-based service GitHub works as a Hub for storing, sharing and collaborating with others. Some tools in GitHub, like pull requests for proposing changes, reviews for asking others to check your work, and issue tracking for monitoring things to be corrected or improved, ease the collaborative work in different projects. Other features (GitHub Actions) allow the automation of different processes, for example, building a web, and testing and deploying code.\nTo learn more about the different elements in GitHub, you can start exploring the GitHub skills courses.\n\n\nWorking with GitHub\nAny Data Science project will benefit from having a clear file structure. The starting point will be a folder (a.k.a. repository) in which we will store the code, data and other relevant files. We are going to use both Git and GitHub for keeping track of all changes.\nYou might already be familiar with some key terms in a typical Git workflow: clone, commit, push, pull, or branch. Here is a useful cheat sheet.\nThere are two main ways of working with GitHub repositories in your machine: the gh command-line tool from the shell and the GitHub desktop graphical user interface. It is also possible to use the built-in IDEs’ extensions, but they generally have fewer features available. We will explore the different actions in the next session.\n\n\nNavigating GitHub\n\nUsing the gh command line interface (CLI)\nYou can search repos, commits, issues, pull requests, and code with the gh CLI tool. For example, to search for repositories related to “transport” sorted by the number of stars, you can run:\ngh search repos --topic transport --sort stars --limit 5\nThat outputs the following:\nShowing 5 of 1081 repositories\n\nNAME                    DESCRIPTION                                                                                   VISIBILITY  UPDATED             \ngboeing/osmnx           Download, model, analyze, and visualize street networks and other geospatial features fro...  public      about 10 hours ago\neclipse-sumo/sumo       Eclipse SUMO is an open source, highly portable, microscopic and continuous traffic simul...  public      about 19 minutes ago\nHaivision/srt           Secure, Reliable, Transport                                                                   public      about 6 hours ago\nenisdenjo/graphql-ws    Coherent, zero-dependency, lazy, simple, GraphQL over WebSocket Protocol compliant server...  public      about 6 hours ago\ngboeing/osmnx-examples  Gallery of OSMnx tutorials, usage examples, and feature demonstrations.                       public      about 16 hours ago\nYou can search for repos related to transport data science with the following and similar commands, as shown in Figure 2.\ngh search repos \"transport data science\" --sort stars --limit 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Search results for transport data science repositories on GitHub using the gh CLI\n\n\n\nSee the gh CLI manual for more details.\n\n\nExploring GitHub’s web interface\nAfter you have logged into github.com, you can use the web application to explore open source software. You can search for people’s profiles and repositories (the public ones) using the search bar. Try looking for a topic, package, or researcher/developer whose work interests you.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you access any public repository, you will typically see the same information in a similar layout:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n\nGitHub organizes a repository’s content and collaboration tools into several key tabs. These tabs act as a dashboard, each providing a different view of the project’s status and activity.\n\n\nThe Main Tabs\n\nCode: This is the repository’s home page. It displays the project’s file and folder structure as it currently exists on the main branch. You can browse and view all the code, read the README file, and see the latest commits, providing a snapshot of the project’s current state.\nIssues: This tab is a central hub for tracking tasks, bugs, and feature requests. It’s a key collaboration tool where developers can open new issues to report problems, ask questions, or propose new ideas. The discussion around an issue is contained in a single thread, keeping conversations organized and searchable.\nPull requests: When a contributor wants to merge their changes from one branch into another, they create a pull request. This tab lists all open, closed, and merged pull requests. Pull requests are where code review happens; collaborators can discuss the proposed changes, add comments, and approve the code before it is integrated into the main project.\nDiscussions: This tab is a more free-form space for conversations that are not tied to a specific bug or feature. It is a place for general questions, project announcements, or sharing ideas with the community. Think of it as a forum built right into the repository, allowing for broader, non-code-related conversations.\n\n\n\n\nCreating and managing repositories\nYou can create a repository from scratch or using an existing folder. The following instructions show the basic process for creating a new repository, which will create a Git repository on your machine and upload it to GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can use the gh command line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI) like GitHub Desktop to create and manage repositories.\nWhile both approaches work, we recommend using the gh CLI because, after you have learned the commands, it is faster, more flexible, and easier to automate repetitive tasks.\nIf you want to create a repository using an existing folder, make sure to navigate to that folder in your terminal before running the gh repo create command.\n\n\n\ngh CLIGitHub Desktop\n\n\nTo create a repository from scratch, go to the location where you want to create your project using the shell, then run gh repo create to access the interactive mode.\nWe will select the first option:\n? What would you like to do?  [Use arrows to move, type to filter] \n&gt; Create a new repository on github.com from scratch\n  Create a new repository on github.com from a template repository\n  Push an existing local repository to github.com\nAssign a name. Remember that this will create a new folder with that name. We will call it myrepository.\n? Repository name\nNow select the owner of the repository, in this case, your username on GitHub.\n? Repository owner  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]\n&gt; yourGHname\nYou can provide a description for the repository. This can be edited afterwards.\n? Repository owner yourGHname\n? Description\nYou can choose whether your repository will be private or public. This can also be edited afterwards.\n? Visibility  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]\n&gt; Public\n  Private\nThe next steps will ask if you want to add README, .gitignore, and license files to your repository. A README file typically explains what the project is, why it is useful, and how others can get started using or contributing to it. A .gitignore file is a plain text file that tells Git which files or directories to intentionally ignore and not track. This is crucial for keeping a repository clean and secure. There are readily available templates based on programming languages; you can pick R in this case. Finally, the license file, if created, clearly states the legal terms under which the project’s code is distributed.\nAfter all questions, the interactive assistant will confirm if you want to create the repository.\n? Would you like to add a README file? Yes\n? Would you like to add a .gitignore? Yes\n? Choose a .gitignore template R\n? Would you like to add a license? Yes\n? Choose a license GNU Affero General Public License v3.0\n? This will create \"myrepository\" as a public repository on github.com. Continue? (Y/n) \nConfirm your repository and explore its contents!\n\n\nOpen the GitHub Desktop app. Click on the File menu and select New repository...\n\nA window asking for the details of your repository will appear.\n\nA .gitignore file is a plain text file that tells Git which files or directories to intentionally ignore and not track. This is crucial for keeping a repository clean and secure. There are readily available templates based on programming languages; you can pick R in this case. Finally, the license file, if created, clearly states the legal terms under which the project’s code is distributed.\nThis process will create the repository locally. In order to publish it on GitHub, you have to click on Publish repository.\n\n\n\n\nOnce your repository is created, you should be able to see it online. To access it, click on the Repositories tab in your profile page and select the repository you just created. You can see a list of repositories in your profile page by clicking on the Repositories tab, or typing github.com/username?tab=repositories in your browser, replacing username with your GitHub username. To see robinlovelace’s repositories, for example, you can type the following into your browser: github.com/Robinlovelace?tab=repositories.\n\n\nIf you want to create a repository from an existing project, you will need to initialize your repository. For this, go to the folder where you have your project with cd &lt;folder path&gt;, and run git init. This will create a local repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nTo be able to use git in the command line, you need to have installed it from here\n\n\n\n\nCloning and Forking repositories\nTo work on a project from GitHub, you first need to create a local copy of the project/repository in your machine. This is referred as cloning the repository. Cloning creates an identical copy of the project, with all the files and their history. If you want to work on someone’s repository and make some changes, you should fork it first. Forking a repository, creates a copy of the project in you own GitHub account, allowing you to make changes and, potentially, contributing to the code/work of others.\n\ngh cliGitHub Desktop\n\n\nGo to the location where you want to store the repository and run: gh repo clone username/repositoryname Replace username/repositoryname with the actual repository path on GitHub.\n\n\nClick File &gt; Clone repository, search for the repository, and choose a local path.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking changes and committing\nA key part of version control is recording the changes in the repository. Once you have created or deleted files, or made any changes, you need to commit them to save a snapshot of your work. In the diagram below, each dot is a commit with a set of changes.\n\n\n\nGit Workflow. From: Git for Data Science by Juha Kiili\n\n\nTo commit changes, you will first need to stage the files containing the changes. Staging means selecting what goes into the\n\nFrom terminalGitHub Desktop\n\n\nFrom the terminal, you can stage a file with the following code:\ngit add &lt;filename&gt;\nAlternatively, if you want to stage all files you can use\ngit add .\nThen, to finally commit changes, use the following code:\ngit commit -m \"Describe your changes\"\nIt is good practice to use concise but clear messages to describe what the change was.\n\n\nIn GitHub Desktop, changes are shown automatically. You may select the files that you want to include in the commit (stage them). Add a descriptive message and click “Commit to main”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPushing changes to GitHub\nUsing git gives you full control of the version control process. This means, that you decide when to publish/synchronise what you have done to the cloud. To update a repository on GitHub with your local commits, push your changes:\n\nFrom terminalGitHub Desktop\n\n\nFrom the terminal, use the following code to push your changes to the cloud:\n  git push\n\n\nClick “Push origin”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollaboration with GitHub\nGitHub enables collaboration by allowing multiple people to work on the same repository. You can use Issues and Discussions to communicate. Imagine that you are working on some analysis in a team. One person in the team identifies a problem with the analysis. That person can open an issue to inform the rest of the team about this problem.\n\nFrom terminalGitHub web\n\n\nUsing the command line, you can create an issue by running:\ngh issue create\n\n\nOn the repository’s site, go to the Issues tab, and then create an issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBranches and pull requests\nBranches let you work on new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. When you create a branch, you effectively create a snapshot of the project at that point and use it as a starting point. It is recommended that you create a branch based on an existing issue, so there is some traceability of why there is a new variation of the project.\nEach issue is assigned a unique numeric ID that you can use to create a branch:\n\nFrom terminalGitHub web\n\n\nTo list all the issues in your repository you can run:\ngh issue list\nTo create a branch from an issue, e.g. #3, you can run:\ngh issue develop 3 --checkout\nUsing --checkout will move you from the main version of the project to the version where you are going to do the work to implement the solution to the issue. You can now start working and committing all necessary changes without affecting the main project. If you need to return to the main branch, you can run git checkout main.\n\n\nIf you open the page of an issue in your repository, you should be able to create a branch from the Development section in the side panel on the right.\n\nThen switch to the branch from the home page of the repository.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have finished working with your branch, you can create a pull request so the changes are incorporated into the main version.\n\nFrom terminalGitHub web\n\n\nUsing the command line, you can create a pull request by running:\ngh pr create\n\n\nIn GitHub Desktop, every time you commit a change on a different branch to main, it will ask you if you want to create a pull request.\n\n\n\nAfter creating a pull request, the owner of the repository, reviews and approves your contribution.\n\n\nMerging changes\nif you are the owner of a repository and you receive a pull request. You can review it and merge it into the main branch.\n\nOn GitHub, click “Merge pull request”.\nLocally, use:\ngh pr merge 1\n\n\n\nResolving conflicts\nConflicts occur when changes in different branches overlap. Git will mark the conflicting files.\n\nOpen the file, look for conflict markers (&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;), and edit to resolve.\nAfter resolving, add and commit the file:\ngit add &lt;filename&gt;\ngit commit\n\n\n\nAutomated workflows with GitHub Actions\nGitHub Actions lets you automate tasks like testing or deployment.\n\nAdd workflow files in .github/workflows/.\nExample: Run tests on every push.\n\n\n\nBest practices for collaboration, sharing code and data\n\nWrite clear commit messages.\nUse branches for features and fixes.\nKeep your repository organized with README, .gitignore, and license files.\nCommunicate using Issues and Discussions.\nReview code via pull requests.\nProtect sensitive data by not uploading secrets.",

    "text": "Introduction to Quarto\nQuarto is a next-generation open-source publishing system that allows you to combine text, code, and the output of that code into a single document. It is designed for technical and scientific communication, enabling the creation of reproducible documents that can be published in a wide variety of formats. You can use Quarto to produce reports, journal articles, presentation slides, books, and dashboards.\n\nQuarto projects\nQuarto documents are authored in a plain text format, using a markup language called Markdown. A markup language is a system for annotating a document using a set of tags or symbols to define the structure, formatting, and other properties of the text within a digital document. You might be familiar with commonly used markup languages like HTML or LaTeX. These languages make the text readable by both humans and machines. Since Quarto documents are based on plain text files, you can use Git and GitHub for version control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you are not familiar with using Markdown, take a look at the short course Communicate using Markdown on GitHub Skills.\n\n\nA Quarto project has two key parts:\n\nSource files: These are the individual documents written in Quarto Markdown, typically with a .qmd extension. They contain the narrative text, code chunks, other blocks, and a header for document-specific options.\n\n\n\n\nA qmd file of this website\n\n\n\nProject File (_quarto.yml): It’s a YAML (YAML Ain’t Markup Language) configuration file that lives in the project’s root directory. It defines global settings for all the documents in the project, such as the project type, metadata, output directories, and project-wide configuration for execution, style, and format. The contents of this file will depend on the type of project you are working on. Here is a sneak peek of the project file for this website:\n\n\n\n\nThe project file of this web\n\n\n\n\nCreating a Quarto project\nYou can create a Quarto project from scratch in an existing repository. First, let’s check that you can use quarto in your command line, and the version you have installed. If you run quarto -v in your shell, you should get the version of Quarto you have installed.\nPS C:\\temp\\tdscience&gt; quarto -v\n1.7.34\nTo create a new project in an existing directory, follow these steps:\n\nGo to your repository with cd &lt;path to repo&gt;\nRun quarto create\nChoose the name and type of project\nOpen the project in your preferred IDE.\n\nAs you see in the following code, Quarto will automatically create a source file and the project file.\nPS C:\\temp&gt; quarto create\n? Create » project\n? Type » default\n? Directory » my-first-quarto-project\n? Title (my-first-quarto-project) » My first quarto project\nCreating project at C:\\temp\\my-first-quarto-project:\n  - Created _quarto.yml\n  - Created My first quarto project.qmd\n? Open With\n❯ positron\n  vscode\n  (don't open)\nYou can also create Quarto projects interactively from the IDE. If you are interested, explore the documentation for RStudio, VSCode, or Positron.\n\n\nBlocks/Chunks\nBlocks in the qmd files are sections that are processed and formatted in a specific way. Blocks can contain code that can be processed in different ways. Chunks are delimited with ``` at the top and bottom, like this:\n```\nThis is a block\n```\nBlocks allow you to include content in HTML or LaTeX in the qmd files as raw code. Specifically for equations, you can use $$ as a delimiter. You can find more useful information on how to use Markdown in Quarto in the Quarto documentation.\n\n\nCode chunks and settings\nCode chunks that have the language name between braces at the start are executed as if you run the code in the console. For example:\n\nRPython\n\n\n```{r}\n# this is a code chunk/block that executes R code\na &lt;- 1 + 3\na\n```\n\n\n```{python}\n# this is a code chunk/block that executes python code\na = 1 + 3\nprint(a)\n```\n\n\n\nThere are several execution options that are useful, for example, to identify each code chunk, or to hide the code, the output, or both. These options are set in the code chunk header and allow you to precisely manage what is visible to the reader. As an example, the following code will hide the source code and only the output Hello World! will be visible in the rendered document.\n\nRPython\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: hello-block-r\n#| echo: false\n\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\n```\n\n\n```{python}\n#| label: hello-block-python\n#| echo: false\n\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\n```\n\n\n\nSee the full details on execution options here. Other options allow you to reference the output of the block. For example, if your code is producing a figure, you can use the label for cross-referencing (more about this will be detailed in the next session), or to set the caption.\n\n\nPublishing your work\nQuarto enables you to generate a wide range of output formats from your project, whether you need an HTML report, a PDF article, a slideshow, or an entire website (like this one). From the command line, you can run quarto render to produce the rendered version of your project, or quarto preview to inspect your edits interactively.\nCombining Quarto and GitHub helps you make your research transparent, collaborative, and easy to share, ensuring that your work is not just published, but also verifiable and ready for future use.",

Follow the steps below to get started.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nGet R and RStudio running (see Prerequisites if needed) before.\n\n\nSetting up your first(?) project:\n\nIn RStudio, go to File &gt; New Project....\n\nSelect New Directory.\nSelect New Project.\nName the project DS-intro-2025 and choose a directory to save it in (your OneDrive might be a good choice).\nClick Create Project.\n\nNavigate to the Files tab, and create two folders in the project directory: data and scripts.\n\nNow using the console only:\n\nType: print(\"Hello, world!\") and hit Enter to see the output.\nNow try: 2 + 2 and hit Enter.\nFind what the current working directory is by typing getwd() and hitting Enter.\nAssign the value 10 to a variable named my_number using the assignment operator &lt;- or =.\nPrint the value of my_number to the console. Did it work?\n\nNow, let’s create your first R script: 8. In RStudio, go to File &gt; New File &gt; R Script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nR scripts allow you to write and save your code. You can run the code directly from the script, and it helps you keep your work organized.\nThink of the script as a recipe that you can follow again and again! If you want to repeat your analysis or share it with others, having it in a script makes it easy.\nAll lines in the script that start with # are comments. They are not executed as code but are there to help explain what the code does.\n\n\n\nSave the script in the scripts folder as 1-basics-intro.R.\nType the following code in the new script:\n# This is my first R script\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\nmy_number &lt;- 10\nprint(my_number)\nRun the code in the script by placing your cursor on each line and pressing Ctrl + Enter (or Cmd + Enter on Mac). Observe the output in the console.\nCreate a vector with 1000 random numbers between 0 and 100. For this, you can use the runif() function. Assign this vector to a variable named random_numbers. Check how to specify the minimum and maximum values in the runif() function by typing ?runif in the console.\nInstall the tidyverse package by typing install.packages(\"tidyverse\") in the console. We won’t use it now, we will load it in the next part.\n\nOptional:\n\nCalculate the mean and standard deviation of the random_numbers vector using the mean() and sd() functions. Print the results to the console.\nSave your script by clicking File &gt; Save or pressing Ctrl + S (or Cmd + S on Mac).\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY-SA 4.0Copyright© 2025 Robin Lovelace & contributors",
