Learn how to filter, transform, and summarize your data effectively.

## Exercise: Filtering and Summarizing Data

### In R

```{r}
#| eval: false

library(tidyverse)

# Filter cars with good fuel efficiency (mpg > 20)
efficient_cars <- mtcars %>%
  filter(mpg > 20)

# Calculate average mpg by cylinder count
mpg_by_cyl <- mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_mpg = mean(mpg),
    count = n()
  )

print(mpg_by_cyl)
```

**Your Task**:
- How many cars have mpg > 20?
- Which cylinder count has the best average fuel efficiency?
- Filter for cars with automatic transmission (`am == 0`)

### In Python

```{python}
#| eval: false

import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns

df = sns.load_dataset('mpg')

# Filter cars from the USA
usa_cars = df[df['origin'] == 'usa']

# Group by year and calculate average mpg
mpg_by_year = df.groupby('model_year')['mpg'].mean()

print(mpg_by_year)
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

::: {.callout-note}
## Filtering not working?
Check your filter conditions. Use `==` for equality and `&` for AND conditions in R, and `==` with `&` in pandas.

## Key Takeaways

After completing this exercise, you should be able to:

✅ Filter data based on conditions  
✅ Group data and calculate summaries  
✅ Transform variables  
✅ Work with multiple conditions
