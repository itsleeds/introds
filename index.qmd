title: Introduction to Data Science
subtitle: Practical Session for MSc Students and Beginners
---

Welcome to this practical introduction to data science! This session was developed for MSc students at the Institute for Transport Studies who are new to data science.
We teach modern data science tools (R, Python, Git), plus how to get started with AI tools like GitHub Copilot.

## About This Session

In this practical, you'll get hands-on experience with data science tools. We'll cover implementations primarily in **R**. **Python** versions of the contents are provided, take your pick!

## Languages

<details>
<summary>Which language should I use?</summary>

There are a number of languages that can be used for data science, including JavaScript/TypeScript, Julia, and MATLAB. However, the two most popular languages are **R** and **Python**. Both are excellent choices for data science, and each has its own strengths, as outlined below.

**Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):** An IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities for writing, testing, and debugging code. Popular IDEs for data science include RStudio, VS Code, and Positron. See the [detailed IDE comparison](https://tdscience.github.io/course/s1.html) for more information.

## R vs Python

If you are unsure which language to pick, we recommend trying both for 10 minutes to see which one "clicks" for you.

**Why choose R?**

-   **"Batteries included":** Base R has built-in support for data frames, reading data from URLs, and statistical models (like linear regression) without needing extra packages.
-   **Development environments:** RStudio and Positron provide excellent Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for R that are user-friendly and often feel familiar to those coming from MATLAB.
-   **Stability:** You are less likely to encounter "dependency hell" because CRAN enforces strict checks on package compatibility.
-   **Community:** R has a massive community specifically focused on statistics and data visualization.

**Why choose Python?**

-   **General Purpose:** Python is used for everything from web development to automation, not just data science.
-   **Deep Learning:** It is the industry standard for machine learning and AI frameworks (like `pytorch` and `openai`).
-   **Readability:** Python syntax is designed to be very readable and close to English.
