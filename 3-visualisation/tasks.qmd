title: "3. Visualisation - Tasks"
---

In this section, we will practice data visualization using R and the `ggplot2` package from the `tidyverse`. Follow the steps below to create various types of plots.

Using the same script `2-data-wrangling-and-visualization.R` from the previous section, continue with the following tasks:

If you have loaded the `tidyverse` package and read in the `crashes` dataset, you can proceed to the next steps. `ggplot2` is part of the `tidyverse`, so you don't need to load it separately.

1. **Box Plot:**
   - Create a box plot to visualise the distribution of ages for different casualty types in the `crashes` dataset.
   - Use `ggplot()` to specify the dataset and aesthetics, and `geom_boxplot()` to create the box plot.
   - Add appropriate labels and a title to your plot.
   - Save the box plot to an object named `age_boxplot`.
   - Display the plot by calling the object name.

2. **Bar Plot (Optional):**
   - Create a bar plot showing the count of casualties by type (pedestrian, cyclist, cat).
   - Add custom colours and transparency to the bars.
   - Add appropriate labels and a title.
   - Save the plot to an object named `casualty_barplot`.

3. **Export Your Plots:**
   - Save the box plot as a PNG file named `age_boxplot.png` using the `ggsave()` function.
   - Save the bar plot as a PNG file named `casualty_barplot.png`.
   - Check the documentation for `ggsave()` by typing `?ggsave` in the console.
