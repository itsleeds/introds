## Data Visualization

Tell stories with your data

---

## Why Visualize?

- Understand patterns quickly
- Communicate findings effectively
- Identify outliers and anomalies
- Explore relationships

---

## Scatter Plots

Show relationships between two continuous variables

---

### Scatter Plot in R

```r
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Fuel Efficiency vs Weight",
       x = "Weight (1000 lbs)",
       y = "Miles per Gallon") +
  theme_minimal()
```

---

## Bar Plots

Show counts or comparisons across categories

---

### Bar Plot in R

```r
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_bar(fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Number of Cars by Cylinders",
       x = "Cylinders",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

---

## Box Plots

Show distributions and outliers

---

### Box Plot in R

```r
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl), y = mpg)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(title = "MPG Distribution by Cylinders",
       x = "Cylinders",
       y = "MPG") +
  theme_minimal()
```

---

## Customization

Make your plots publication-ready

---

### Customizing in R

```r
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("4" = "#E69F00", 
                                 "6" = "#56B4E9", 
                                 "8" = "#F8766D"),
                     name = "Cylinders") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"))
```

## Python Content (Optional)

If you're interested in Python, here are some equivalent concepts

---

### Scatter Plot in Python

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

df = sns.load_dataset('mpg')

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='weight', y='mpg')
plt.title('Fuel Efficiency vs Weight')
plt.xlabel('Weight')
plt.ylabel('Miles per Gallon')
plt.show()
```

---

### Bar Plot in Python

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

df = sns.load_dataset('mpg')

sns.countplot(data=df, x='cylinders')
plt.title('Number of Cars by Cylinders')
plt.show()
```

---

### Box Plot in Python

```python
sns.boxplot(data=df, x='cylinders', y='mpg')
plt.title('MPG Distribution by Cylinders')
plt.show()
```

---

### Customizing in Python

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
for cyl in df['cylinders'].unique():
    subset = df[df['cylinders'] == cyl]
    plt.scatter(subset['weight'], subset['mpg'], 
               label=f'{cyl} cylinders', s=100, alpha=0.7)
plt.legend()
plt.title('Fuel Efficiency vs Weight by Cylinders')
plt.xlabel('Weight')
plt.ylabel('MPG')
plt.grid(alpha=0.3)
plt.show()
```
