title: AI Tools & Policy
---

AI-powered coding assistants can significantly accelerate your data science learning journey. However, it is critical to use them safely and in compliance with University regulations.

## The "Traffic Light" System

The University of Leeds uses a [traffic light system](https://generative-ai.leeds.ac.uk/ai-and-assessments/categories-of-assessments/) to indicate how AI can be used in assessments. **Always check your specific module guidelines.**

-   🔴 **Red:** No AI permitted. You must do all the work yourself.
-   🟠 **Amber:** AI permitted as a supportive tool (e.g., for ideation, debugging, or explaining concepts) but not for generating the final output.
-   🟢 **Green:** AI is integral to the assessment and can be used freely (with appropriate acknowledgement).

## 1. The "Official" Route (Safe for Coursework)

**Microsoft 365 Copilot** (Enterprise) is the University-endorsed tool.

*   **Why:** This version is **private**. Your data is *not* used to train the model (see [University guidance on GenAI tools](https://generative-ai.leeds.ac.uk/intro-gen-ai/generative-ai-tools/)). This is the recommended tool for university work where AI is permitted.
*   **Access:** Log in to [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft365.com) with your University credentials (`@leeds.ac.uk`).
*   **Usage:** Use it to draft text, summarize documents, or explain code concepts securely.

## 2. The "Developer" Route (For Personal Skills)

**GitHub Copilot** is an industry-standard AI pair programmer.

*   **Context:** While excellent for coding, the standard/student version may not have the same data protections as the University's Enterprise tools.
*   **Usage:** Use this for **personal learning** and building your developer portfolio.
*   **Warning:** ⚠️ **Do not** paste unpublished assessment questions, sensitive research data, or participant information into these tools.

### Getting Access (Student Pack)

Students can get **free access** to the GitHub Student Developer Pack (a valuable industry perk):

1.  Visit [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/)
2.  Apply for the Student Developer Pack using your `.ac.uk` email (for verification only).
3.  Once verified, you can install the GitHub Copilot extension in VS Code or RStudio.

## Best Practices

::: callout-tip
### Writing Good Prompts

-   Write clear comments describing what you want to do
-   Use descriptive variable names
-   Break complex tasks into smaller steps
:::

**DOs** ✅

-   Use AI to understand error messages
-   Ask AI to explain unfamiliar code
-   Use suggestions to learn new approaches
-   **Verify** AI-generated code before using it

**DON'Ts** ❌

-   Don't blindly copy-paste without understanding
-   Don't use AI to do all your work (you won't learn!)
-   **Don't share sensitive/personal data with AI tools**
-   Don't assume AI code is always correct

## Critical Thinking Required

AI tools are powerful assistants, but they can make mistakes. Always review and test the code they generate!
