Before starting this practical session, you'll need to set up a few essential tools. Don't worry—we'll keep this brief!

## Required Software {.unnumbered}

### If using AppsAnywhere {.unnumbered}

If you're using [AppsAnywhere ](https://appsanywhere.leeds.ac.uk/)(available on university computers or your own laptop):

1.  Open AppsAnywhere on your computer

2.  Search for and launch **R for Wndows** first

4.  For Python (optional), search for and launch **Anaconda** from AppsAnywhere

### Cloud-based Development Environments (Recommended) {.unnumbered}

For the easiest setup and to ensure everyone is working in a consistent environment, we highly recommend using a cloud-based development environment like **GitHub Codespaces**. This sets up a fully configured development environment in your browser, with all the necessary software pre-installed.

To open this project in GitHub Codespaces, click the link below:

[Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/new/itsleeds/introds?quickstart=1) <!-- [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20in-GitHub%20Codespaces-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/codespaces/new/itsleeds/introds?quickstart=1) -->

**Benefits:**

-   **Zero Setup:** No need to install anything on your local machine.
-   **Consistent Environment:** Everyone uses the exact same tools and configurations.
-   **Powerful:** Runs on cloud servers, providing ample computing resources.
-   **Accessible:** Works from any modern web browser.
-   **GitHub Account Required:** You need a GitHub account to use Codespaces.
-   **Free Usage Tier:** As of November 2025, GitHub Codespaces offers a free tier of 120 hours of CPU time per month.

### If installing on your own laptop {.unnumbered}

This approach is recommended if you want more control over your installations and if you plan to continue using these tools after the session:

#### 1. Development Environment (IDE) {.unnumbered}

An **IDE** (Integrated Development Environment) provides a comprehensive workspace for coding. Popular options include:

**For R:**

-   **RStudio Desktop** (free) from [Posit](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) - Specifically designed for R
-   **Positron** from [Posit](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron) - New IDE supporting both R and Python (beta)

**For multiple languages:**

-   **VS Code** from [Microsoft](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Versatile IDE with extensions for R, Python, and more

#### 2. Programming Languages {.unnumbered}

**R** is a programming language widely used for statistical computing and data science.

-   Download R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)

**Python** (Optional but Recommended) is another popular language for data science.

-   Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.8 or higher)
-   Or install via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) (includes many data science packages)

## Getting Help {.unnumbered}

If you encounter installation issues:

-   Check the [RStudio Support](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us) page
