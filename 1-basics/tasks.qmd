title: "1. Basics - Tasks"
---

Complete these tasks to practice the concepts from the slides.

## Task 1: Explore Data Types

Try the following in your R or Python console:

### In R

```r
# Create different data types
x <- 42
y <- 3.14
name <- "Data Science"
is_fun <- TRUE

# Check their types
class(x)
typeof(y)
class(name)
typeof(is_fun)
```

**Questions**:
- What is the difference between numeric and integer?
- Can you create an integer variable?

### In Python

```python
x = 42
y = 3.14
name = "Data Science"
is_fun = True

type(x)
type(y)
type(name)
type(is_fun)
```

## Task 2: Working with Vectors and Lists

### In R

```r
# Create a vector
my_vector <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

# Access elements
my_vector[1]
my_vector[2:4]
my_vector[c(1, 3, 5)]
```

**Questions**:
- What does `my_vector[2:4]` return?
- How would you get only the first and last elements?
- Create a vector of your own and practice indexing

### In Python

```python
my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Access elements
my_list[0]      # Remember: 0-based indexing!
my_list[1:4]
my_list[::2]    # Every second element
```

**Questions**:
- Why does `my_list[0]` give you the first element?
- What does `my_list[1:4]` return?
- How would you get every other element?

## Task 3: Creating and Accessing Data Frames

### In R

```r
# Create a data frame
people <- data.frame(
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana"),
  age = c(25, 30, 28, 35),
  city = c("London", "Manchester", "London", "Birmingham")
)

# Explore it
head(people)
str(people)
nrow(people)
ncol(people)

# Access data
people$name
people[1, ]
people[, "age"]
people[people$age > 28, ]
```

**Tasks**:
- How many people are in the data frame?
- What are the column names?
- Get all rows where age is greater than 28
- Get the name of the second person

### In Python

```python
import pandas as pd

people = pd.DataFrame({
    "name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana"],
    "age": [25, 30, 28, 35],
    "city": ["London", "Manchester", "London", "Birmingham"]
})

# Explore it
people.head()
people.info()
people.shape

# Access data
people["name"]
people.iloc[0]
people.loc[people["age"] > 28]
```

**Tasks**:
- How many people are in the data frame?
- What are the column names?
- Get all rows where age is greater than 28
- Get the name of the second person

## Task 4: Understanding Packages

### In R

```r
# If not already installed:
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Load the package
library(tidyverse)

# Now you have access to tidyverse functions
# Try accessing the help for a function
?filter
?select
```

**Tasks**:
- Install a new package of your choice
- Load it with `library()`
- Look up help for one of its functions

### In Python

```python
# If not already installed (in terminal):
# pip install pandas

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Check the version
print(pd.__version__)
print(np.__version__)

# Look up help
help(pd.DataFrame)
```

**Tasks**:
- Import pandas and check its version
- Import numpy and check its version
- Look up the help for one function

## Task 5: Data Types and Operators Challenge

### In R

```r
# Perform calculations
result1 <- 10 + 5 * 2          # What's the order of operations?
result2 <- (10 + 5) * 2        # Does parentheses change it?
result3 <- 17 %% 5             # What does modulo give?
result4 <- 2 ^ 10              # What's 2 to the power of 10?

# Mixed types
mixed_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, "hello")
class(mixed_vector)            # What type is this?
```

**Questions**:
- What are the values of result1, result2, result3, result4?
- Why is the mixed_vector converted to character?

### In Python

```python
result1 = 10 + 5 * 2
result2 = (10 + 5) * 2
result3 = 17 % 5
result4 = 2 ** 10

mixed_list = [1, 2, 3, "hello"]
type(mixed_list)               # What type is this?

# This won't work - why?
# result = 1 + "hello"
```

**Questions**:
- What are the values of result1, result2, result3, result4?
- Can you add a number to a string in Python?
