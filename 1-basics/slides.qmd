## Welcome to the Fundamentals!

This section covers the essential concepts and tools you need to get started with data science.

---

## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

Your toolkit for writing code

---

### RStudio

RStudio has four main panels:

1. **Source Editor** (top-left): Write and edit R code
2. **Console** (bottom-left): Code execution and results
3. **Environment/History** (top-right): Variables and command history
4. **Files/Plots/Packages/Help** (bottom-right): File browser and help

**Tip**: Customize the layout via View → Panes → Pane Layout

---

### VS Code

When working with Python and R:

1. **Editor** (left): Write your code
2. **Explorer** (left sidebar): Navigate project files
3. **Terminal** (bottom): Run commands and see output
4. **Extensions Panel**: Install packages for Python, R, Quarto

**Popular Extensions**: Python, R, Pylance, Quarto

## Data Types and Structures

The fundamental building blocks

---

### Data Types in R

```r
# Numeric, Integer, Character, Logical
x <- 42          # numeric
y <- 42L         # integer
name <- "Alice"  # character
flag <- TRUE     # logical

class(x)
typeof(x)
```

**Key Types**:
- `numeric`: Real numbers
- `integer`: Whole numbers only
- `character`: Text strings
- `logical`: TRUE or FALSE

---

### Vectors in R

Sequences of values of the same type:

```r
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
names <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie")
flags <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)

first_number <- numbers[1]
first_three <- numbers[1:3]
```

---

### Data Frames in R

Tables with rows and columns:

```r
students <- data.frame(
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"),
  age = c(20, 21, 19),
  grade = c("A", "B", "A")
)

students$name      # access column
students[1, ]      # access row
head(students)     # view data
```

---

### Lists in R

Flexible containers for mixed types:

```r
my_list <- list(
  name = "Alice",
  age = 20,
  scores = c(85, 90, 88),
  data = data.frame(x = 1:3, y = 4:6)
)

my_list$name
my_list[[1]]
```

---

## Organizing Your Work

Project structure and file paths

---

### Recommended Folder Structure

```
my-project/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/              # Original data files
│   └── processed/        # Cleaned data
├── code/
│   ├── analysis.R
│   └── plots.R
├── outputs/
│   ├── figures/
│   └── results/
├── README.md
└── my-project.Rproj
```

Keep your work organized for easy collaboration and maintenance.

---

### Working with Paths in R

**Relative paths** (from current working directory):

```r
# Set working directory
setwd("C:/Users/Alice/my-project")

# Read data using relative path
data <- read.csv("data/raw/mydata.csv")
```

**Absolute paths** (full path from root):

```r
# Read using absolute path
data <- read.csv("C:/Users/Alice/my-project/data/raw/mydata.csv")
```

**Best practice**: Use relative paths for portability.

---

## Control Flow

Making decisions and repeating tasks

---

### If Statements in R

Execute code conditionally:

```r
age <- 25

if (age >= 18) {
  print("Adult")
} else {
  print("Minor")
}

# Multiple conditions
if (age < 13) {
  category <- "Child"
} else if (age < 18) {
  category <- "Teen"
} else {
  category <- "Adult"
}
```

---

### For Loops in R

Repeat code multiple times:

```r
# Simple loop
for (i in 1:5) {
  print(i)
}

# Loop over vector
fruits <- c("apple", "banana", "cherry")
for (fruit in fruits) {
  print(paste("I like", fruit))
}

# Store results
results <- numeric(5)
for (i in 1:5) {
  results[i] <- i ^ 2
}
results  # 1, 4, 9, 16, 25
```

---

## R as a Calculator

Simple operations:

```r
2 + 3           # Addition
10 - 4          # Subtraction
5 * 6           # Multiplication
20 / 4          # Division
2 ^ 3           # Exponentiation
10 %% 3         # Modulo
```

---

## Understanding Packages in R

Collections of functions to extend capabilities

---

### Installing and Loading Packages

```r
# Install once
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Load each session
library(tidyverse)
```

Functions available:
- `filter()`, `select()`, `mutate()`
- `ggplot()` for visualization

---

## Python Content (Optional)

If you're interested in Python, here are some equivalent concepts

---

### Working with Paths in Python

**Relative paths**:

```python
import os

# Change working directory
os.chdir("C:/Users/Alice/my-project")

# Read data using relative path
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("data/raw/mydata.csv")
```

**Absolute paths**:

```python
data = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/Alice/my-project/data/raw/mydata.csv")
```

**Best practice**: Use relative paths or `pathlib` for portability.

---

### If Statements in Python

```python
age = 25

if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Minor")

# Multiple conditions
if age < 13:
    category = "Child"
elif age < 18:
    category = "Teen"
else:
    category = "Adult"
```

---

### For Loops in Python

```python
# Simple loop
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)

# Loop over list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"I like {fruit}")

# Store results
results = []
for i in range(1, 6):
    results.append(i ** 2)
print(results)  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

---

### Data Types in Python

```python
x = 42          # int
y = 3.14        # float
name = "Alice"  # str
flag = True     # bool

type(x)
type(name)
```

**Key Types**:

- `int`: Integers
- `float`: Decimal numbers
- `str`: Text strings
- `bool`: True or False

---

### Lists in Python

Ordered collections (can be mixed types):

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
mixed = [1, "Alice", 3.14, True]

first = numbers[0]      # 0-based indexing!
first_three = numbers[0:3]
```

---

### Dictionaries in Python

Key-value pairs:

```python
student = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 20,
    "grade": "A"
}

student["name"]
student.get("age")
```

---

### NumPy Arrays

Similar to R vectors:

```python
import numpy as np

numbers = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

first = numbers[0]
```

---

### Pandas DataFrames

Tables in Python:

```python
import pandas as pd

students = pd.DataFrame({
    "name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"],
    "age": [20, 21, 19],
    "grade": ["A", "B", "A"]
})

students["name"]
students.head()
```

---

### Importing Packages in Python

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
```

**Popular packages**:
- `pandas`: Data manipulation
- `numpy`: Numerical computing
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: Visualization
- `scikit-learn`: Machine learning
