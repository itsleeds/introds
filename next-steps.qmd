## Build Your Portfolio

### Project Ideas

1. **Analyze local transport patterns** using open transport data
2. **Recreate published analyses** to learn techniques
4. **Contribute to open source** R or Python packages

### Share Your Work

- Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) profile for your code
- Build a portfolio website with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)
- Write blog posts about what you learn
- Share projects on social media (#RStats, #DataScience)

## Advanced Topics to Explore

Once you're comfortable with basics:

### Data Science Skills

- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for collaboration
- **Reproducible Research**: R Markdown, Quarto, Jupyter notebooks

### Specialized Topics

- **Spatial Data Science**: Working with spatial data (check out [geocompx.org](https://geocompx.org/))
- **Machine Learning**: Supervised and unsupervised learning
- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks for complex patterns
- **Time Series Analysis**: For temporal data
- **Network Analysis**: For transport networks and relationships
