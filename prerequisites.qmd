Before starting this practical session, you'll need to set up a few essential tools. Don't worry—we'll keep this brief!

## Required Software

### If using AppsAnywhere

If you're using AppsAnywhere (available on university computers or your own laptop):

1. Open AppsAnywhere on your computer
2. Search for and launch **R** first
3. Search for and launch **RStudio** (requires R to be installed)
4. For Python (optional), search for and launch **Anaconda** from AppsAnywhere

### If installing on your own laptop

This approach is recommended if you want more control over your installations and if you plan to continue using these tools after the session:

#### 1. R and RStudio

**R** is a programming language widely used for statistical computing and data science.

- Download R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- Download RStudio Desktop (free) from [Posit](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

#### 2. Python (Optional but Recommended)

**Python** is another popular language for data science.

- Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.8 or higher)
- Or install via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) (includes many data science packages)
