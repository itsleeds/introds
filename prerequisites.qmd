Before starting this practical session, you'll need to set up a few essential tools. Don't worry—we'll keep this brief!

## Required Software

### If using AppsAnywhere

If you're using AppsAnywhere (available on university computers or your own laptop):

1. Open AppsAnywhere on your computer
2. Search for and launch **R** first
3. Search for and launch **RStudio** (requires R to be installed)
4. For Python (optional), search for and launch **Anaconda** from AppsAnywhere

### If installing on your own laptop

This approach is recommended if you want more control over your installations and if you plan to continue using these tools after the session:

#### 1. Development Environment (IDE)

An **IDE** (Integrated Development Environment) provides a comprehensive workspace for coding. Popular options include:

**For R:**
- **RStudio Desktop** (free) from [Posit](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) - Specifically designed for R
- **Positron** from [Posit](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron) - New IDE supporting both R and Python (beta)

**For multiple languages:**
- **VS Code** from [Microsoft](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Versatile IDE with extensions for R, Python, and more

#### 2. Programming Languages

**R** is a programming language widely used for statistical computing and data science.

- Download R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)

**Python** (Optional but Recommended) is another popular language for data science.

- Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.8 or higher)
- Or install via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) (includes many data science packages)

## Getting Help
